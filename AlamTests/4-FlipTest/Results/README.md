This results folder has 8 files:-

1. `path_length_diff.csv`: This shows the difference in path lengths for each bird pair.

2. `prop_by_bird.csv`: This shows the proportion that each bird has the longer path across pairs and UMAPs.

3. `prop_by_nsyll.png`:  This shows the proportion that each bird has the longer path across pairs and UMAPs.

4. `prop_by_nsylldiff.png`:  This shows the proportion that one bird in each bird pair has the longer path as a function of the difference in their number of syllables.

5. `path_length_diff.png` and `path_length_diff.pdf`: This displays the path length difference of each pair across multiple UMAP renditions.

6. `path_length_bysyll_diff.png` and `path_length_bysyll_diff.pdf`: This displays the path length difference of each pair across multiple UMAP renditions, but normalised by the difference in their number of syllables.
