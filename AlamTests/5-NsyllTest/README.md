## Testing global distances between UMAP clusters

We test one argument:

1. Is the path length in UMAP related to the number of clustes comprising the path? i.e. is a bird's path length related to the number of syllables.



Here, you will find the fifth test:-

5. `Nsyll Test`

	- In this test, we use one UMAP rendition of the 31 tutored birds from the Alam dataset.
	- For k=2,3,..8, we choose random k clusters from the given UMAP.
	- We compute the corresponding path length.
	- We repeat this process 50 times.
	- We observe if the path length of such randomly constructed paths is related to the number of clusters comprising the paths, i.e. is the path length of a bird related to its number of syllables. 




The folder `Results` has the relevant results for this test.
	
Specific information  about  these  files is provided in the corresponding README.



Note:

- All the tests were conducted on non-normalised UMAP embeddings.
- The cluster labels are a combination of what they provided + kmeans.
