This folder has the scripts used in `Bulla, et al 2025` to generate the UMAPs from the `Alam et. al 2024` dataset.



`RseedTest`:

- Scripts and results corresponding to the path length repeatability test.
- This test makes 20 UMAP embeddings of the entire dataset of 31 tutored birds.
- It changes no parameters, except the seed for the random number generator.
- It tests the repeatability of the path length for each bird, across multiple UMAP renditions.
