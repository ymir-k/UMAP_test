## Test #3 Split Reproducibility


In the article `No support for honest signalling of male quality in zebra finch song; Bulla, Sankar, Forstmeier, 2025`, we test the reliability of the path length metric, as described in [Alam et al. (2024, Nature)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07207-4).

We test the path length metric in various contexts, one of which is described in this folder.
We provide here the corresponding scripts and results.



We test this argument:

- Is the path length of a birdsong consistent across different colonies of birds? i.e. Is the path length metric reproducible?


#### Test description


Here, you will find the description of the test we run to examine the above argument.

	- In this test, we use the 31 tutored birds from Alam et. al ("tut.csv").
	- 1 bird is chosen as the focal bird.
	- The 30 non focal birds are randomly split into two, with 15 birds each.
	- This makes 2 subsets of 16 birds each, both including the focal bird.
	- We generate the UMAP embeddings for these 2 subsets with the given focal bird.
	- We compute the path length of the focal bird in these 2 UMAPs.
	- Then, we repeat this for each of the 31 birds.
	- This generates 31*2=62 path lengths, 2 each per bird.
	- Separately, in R, we check the reproducibility of the path length of a bird, given different neighbours.
